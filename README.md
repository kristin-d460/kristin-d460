## Hi there 👋


**kristin-d460/kristin-d460** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Mr.Jameson's ICS3U
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the home buttons (they still don't work)
- 💬 Ask me about video games (I don't know)
- 📫 How to reach me: kristin.doyle@stu.ocsb.ca
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I hate get to know me activities
